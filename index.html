            The tells your browser the title of the page and you’ll see this text at the very top of your
                web browser. This is also used by most search engines when indexing your page. Whatever text
                you have here will be the title of your site when displayed in the search engines.

                The <meta name> information is also somewhat useful for some search engines. They may use
                whatever is in your "description" tag to describe your site. Others may randomly take an excerpt
                of the <body> of your page for a description of your site. The keyword tag may also be helpful
                with your ranking in some engines. Insert 3 or 4 of your main keywords or keyword phrases
                separated by commas here.

                A few years ago, the <meta name> information was quite crucial in getting a top listing with the
                search engines. However, things have changed drastically with the explosion of so many new
                sites and the fact that many people abused it. I would still recommend using these tags but don’t
                expect to get a top ranking because of them.
